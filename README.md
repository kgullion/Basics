Eagle parts library

This is a work in progress. The goal is to create a well organized, accurate and consistent library of parts that is in the public domain. This means it is free for use by anyone for any purpose without restriction under copyright law.

The parts I design are in the context of guitar pedals but feel free to contribute anything you'd like and we can probably find a place for it. Just make sure it is either your own work or in the public domain.
